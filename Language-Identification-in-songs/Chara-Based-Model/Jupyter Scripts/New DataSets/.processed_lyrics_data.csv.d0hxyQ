"In the heart of the city, under a clouded sky, 

Battles raging within, as the world passes by. 

Dreams like glass, shattered and strewn, 

Echoes of laughter, now silent at noon. 

في الظلام هناك نور، ينتظر أن يتفتح  

قوة في القلب، تزدهر في كل خطوة   

 

Espoir dans chaque souffle, amour dans chaque mot 

أحلامنا تحلق عاليًا، فوق السحاب  

La lumière nous guide, نحو الأمل  

Dans les rues silencieuses, je trouve ma force, 

Cherchant la paix, dans ce chaos de course. 

Chaque pas en avant, un pas vers la lumière, 

Dans mon coeur, une flamme, un esprit de guerrière. 

 

We rise, à travers les orages. أيدي متحدة  In our song  

 

 الفجر يبزغ 

Hope reborn from the ashes, in every belief. 

With every challenge, نواجهه nous le surmontons, 

Our spirits, free as the wind, forever strong.

Holding onto dreams, feeling incomplete.
Walls closing in, a maze with no end,
Crying out for the light, on hope to depend.

الغد أفضل، نرسمه بأرواحنا

Face aux tempêtes, je garde ma dignité.

"En el alba, partimos con sueños en la mochila,
Caminos desconocidos, el mundo es nuestra pista.
El sol besa las montañas, la brisa nos invita,
Vamos juntos, compañeros, en esta danza infinita.

Die Sterne leiten uns, in der Nacht so klar und hell,
Das Herz voller Vorfreude, klopft schnell, oh so schnell.
Jedes Lied des Windes, ruft uns zu neuen Ufern,
Wir sind bereit zu fliegen, die Segel sind gehoben.

세상의 끝까지, Wir reisen durch die Zeit,
새로운 발견, Freiheit, Glück, so weit.
함께라면, jeder Schritt ist neu,
모험의 노래를 부르며, Im Licht der Morgentau.

모르는 길 위에서, 가슴이 뛰어요,
낯선 하늘 아래, 새로운 꿈을 꿔요.
푸른 바다를 건너, 숲속을 헤매어,
매 순간이 빛나는, 이 여행의 선물.

Aventuras sin fin, Abenteuer warten dort,
손에 손을 잡고, juntos, Schritt für Schritt.
Cada cultura, Sprache, 색깔이 다른 세상,
Entdecken wir zusammen, en esta canción.

En cada rincón del mundo, 새 이야기를 들려요,
속삭이는 바람, nos trae canciones de ayer.
Juntos en este viaje, 매 순간이 즐거워,
Exploramos corazones, bajo el cielo estrellado.

세상의 끝까지, Bis ans Ende der Zeit,
새로운 발견, Freiheit, en la eternidad.
함께라면, jeder Schritt ist neu,
모험의 노래를 부르며, Im Licht der Morgentau.
Zusammen gehen wir weiter, en esta danza sin fin

"В сердце мира, любовь как песня звучит,
В каждом уголке земли, она светит и живет.
Разные лица, но чувства одни и те же,
Любовь объединяет нас, в единстве наша сила.
इस धरती पर सब मिलकर, गीत प्यार का गाएं,
संस्कृतियों के मिलन से, नया इतिहास बनाएं।
दिलों का करीब आना, एकता का जश्न मनाएं।
In every language, love speaks the same,
दिलों की धड़कन, the heartbeat the same.
Hand in hand, across lands and seas,
साथ मिलकर, together, in harmony, we're free.
From the snowy peaks to the sun-kissed shores,
Love's language resonates, opens every door.
Embracing differences, celebrating similarities,
In love, we find our shared humanities.

Через горы и моря, through trials and time,
Любовь нас ведет, love leads us in our prime.

In nature's gallery, each plays its part.

"No silêncio da noite, sob a luz do luar,
O amor sussurra histórias, em um doce olhar.
Em cada gesto pequeno, um universo a revelar,
Nas estrelas, nossos sonhos começam a dançar.
En cada suspiro, una promesa nace,
El corazón canta, en la distancia que nos abrace.
Manos entrelazadas, en un destino compartido,
El amor nos guía, en un viaje sin olvido.
In this dance of hearts, across the miles,
Donde quiera que estés, love defies the trials.
Under the same sky, our souls connect,
En cada palabra, in every aspect.
From the rolling hills to the bustling city streets,
Our love story echoes, where every culture meets.
In the language of the heart, no barriers to be found,
In love's melody, our hearts are bound.
Nas melodias do amor, en las melodías del amor, in love's tune,
Cada olhar, cada toque, is a shared boon.
In the fusion of our souls, cultures blend and shine,
Em cada sorriso, en cada caricia, love's design.
Com cada amanhecer, with each new day's light,
Nosso amor renasce, shining so bright.
In the warmth of our embrace, no distance too far,
Em cada momento, in every moment, there we are.
In this dance of hearts, across the miles,
Donde quiera que estés, love defies the trials.
Under the same sky, our souls intertwine,
En cada sueño, in every line.","PT,ES,EN",GPT,,no silêncio da noite sob a luz do luar o amor sussurra histórias em um doce olhar em cada gesto pequeno um universo a revelar nas estrelas nossos sonhos

"Nas cores da manhã, a vida se desenha,
Risos e cantos enchem o ar, em cada pequena façanha.
Cada momento um presente, um milagre a celebrar,
Na dança do dia, a vida a brilhar.
En cada sonrisa, una fiesta de emociones,
La vida es un canto, lleno de colores y canciones.
Manos al cielo, corazones abiertos,
Celebramos juntos, nuestros descubrimientos.
Celebrate the moments, big and small,
En cada paso, life’s a carnival.
Joy in the journey, love in the air,
En cada mirada, everywhere.
From the laughter of children to the wisdom of age,
Life's a book, and every day's a new page.
In simple pleasures, we find our greatest treasure,
In each heartbeat, life’s measure.
Em cada abraço, en cada abrazo, in every embrace,
A vida nos ensina, la vida nos enseña, life's grace.
In the unity of moments, joy’s sweet song,
No sorriso compartilhado, where we all belong.
Com a luz do entardecer, with the evening's glow,
Reflectimos sobre a beleza, and all we know.
In each shared story, em cada risada,
We find life’s glory, a journey unmatched.
Celebrate the moments, big and small,
En cada paso, life’s a carnival.
Joy in the journey, love in the air,
En cada rincón, love to share.","PT,ES,EN",GPT,,nas cores da manhã a vida se desenha risos e cantos enchem o ar em cada pequena façanha cada momento um presente um milagre a celebrar na dança do dia a

"Largando as amarras, rumo ao horizonte,
Em cada maré, um novo monte,
O mundo me chama, não posso resistir,
Nas asas do vento, começo a partir.

Cada ciudad, un nuevo comienzo,
La aventura me susurra, en el silencio,
En cada calle, un misterio por descubrir,
La vida es un viaje, y estoy listo para ir.

Sailing the seas, sailing the dreams, en aguas profundas,
Discovering lands, under foreign suns, bajo lunas redondas,
Each moment a treasure, cada paso una canción,
Adventure's in my heart, it's where I belong.

Through ancient ruins, in bustling streets,
Every corner of the world, where culture greets,
The thrill of the new, in every sight and sound,
In the book of the world, new chapters are found.

Na dança das ondas, en la brisa del mar,
Finding my path, following a distant star,
Cada experiência, a new piece of the puzzle,
En este viaje, life's vibrant hustle.
Nas histórias contadas, under foreign skies,
Novas amizades, where laughter lies,

The joy of discovery, in every new face,
In this journey of life, every step is grace.
Sailing the seas, sailing the dreams, en aguas profundas,
Discovering lands, under foreign suns, bajo lunas redondas,
Each moment a treasure, cada paso una canción,
Adventure's in my heart, it's where I belong.
En cada aventura, un nuevo aprender,
La vida se despliega, hay tanto que ver,
Con cada amanecer, mi alma se renueva,
En el viaje de la vida, cada día es una prueba.","PT,ES,EN",GPT,,largando as amarras rumo ao horizonte em cada maré um novo monte o mundo me chama não posso resistir nas asas do vento começo a partir

"Sur le chemin de l'aventure, sous un ciel étoilé,
Le monde nous appelle, nos cœurs sont alliés,
Chaque pas un tableau, peint de rêves dorés,
Dans ce voyage, nos âmes sont guidées.

Con ogni respiro, un'emozione nasce,
L'anticipazione cresce, come un fiume in corsa,
Sotto la luna, il nostro cammino si abbraccia,
Verso l'ignoto, dove la vita scorre audace.

Discovering worlds, scoprendo verità,
In each new land, una nuova libertà,
With every sunrise, un nuovo inizio,
Embracing life, abbracciando il destino.

Across the oceans, through the wilds, under the sun,
Every new horizon, a new adventure begun,
The thrill of the unknown, calling loud and clear,
In this journey of discovery, everything's near.

Dans le souffle du vent, nel susurro delle foglie,
Finding our path, trouvant notre voie,
Chaque culture, ogni storia, a new chapter unfolds,
In this dance of life, la danza delle mondi.

Dans les rues animées, under starlit skies,
Nouvelles rencontres, new bonds arise,
La joie de découvrir, in every shared smile,
In this tapestry of life, chaque moment vaut la peine.

"Dans le jardin de l'amour, les fleurs commencent à fleurir,
Chaque regard, chaque sourire, fait battre le cœur,
Sous le ciel étoilé, l'amour nous invite à danser,
Dans ce ballet de sentiments, nos âmes se lient.

In ogni sguardo, una promessa nasconde,
La passione arde, come una stella che risponde,
Mani intrecciate, in un viaggio senza fine,
L'amore ci chiama, in una danza divina.

In this dance of love, in questa danza d'amore,
Two hearts beat as one, due cuori in un battito,
In every embrace, in ogni abbraccio sentito,
We find our universe, nel nostro universo infinito.

Through the whispers of the night, in the laughter of the day,
Love's melody plays, in an enchanting ballet,
In your eyes, I find my stars, in your arms, my home,
In the rhythm of love, we're never alone.

Dans chaque mot doux, in ogni carezza,
Love's language speaks, l'amour confesse,
Each moment shared, ogni momento condiviso,
Builds our forever, notre éternel paradiso.

Sous la lune, under the sun's warm embrace,
Chaque baiser, every touch, a tender grace,
In this journey of love, dans ce voyage d'amour,
Every day is a gift, chaque jour un nouveau jour.

In this dance of love, in questa danza d'amore,

"Dans le silence de la nuit, l'espoir murmure doucement,
Face aux épreuves de la vie, on trouve la force en dedans,
Chaque larme, une leçon, dans l'obscurité, une lumière,
Dans la quête de l'horizon, l'espoir est notre frontière.

In ogni dolore, c'è una speranza che brilla,
Nel cuore della notte, una stella che scintilla,
Con ogni passo, affrontiamo la tempesta,
Nella speranza, troviamo la nostra festa.

Rising up, rising strong, alzandoci con forza,
In the face of the dark, nella faccia dell'oscurità,
Holding on to hope, tenendo la speranza,
We find our way, troviamo la nostra strada.

Through the trials and the storms, we walk with courage in our heart,
Every challenge, a chance to make a brand new start,
In the echoes of despair, we find a resilient song,
With hope as our compass, we know we belong.

Dans chaque défi, in ogni sfida, a ray of light,
Finding strength, trouvant la force, in the darkest night,
Chaque pas, ogni passo, a journey of the soul,
In this dance of life, in questa danza, we are whole.

Sous les étoiles, under the moon's gentle gaze,
Nous trouvons la voie, in the maze of our days,
Hope guiding us, l'espoir nous guidant, through every night and day,
In the symphony of life, dans la symphonie, we find our way.

Rising up, rising strong, alzandoci con forza,
In the face of the dark, nella faccia dell'oscurità,
Holding on to hope, tenendo la speranza,
We find our way, troviamo la nostra strada.
Con ogni alba, una nuova promessa nasce,
Nel cammino della vita, la speranza mai si tace,
Camminando insieme, con la luce nel cuore,
Nella speranza, troviamo il nostro amore.","FR,IT,EN",GPT,,dans le silence de la nuit l'espoir murmure doucement face aux épreuves de la vie on trouve la force en dedans chaque larme une leçon dans

"Dans le jardin de la vie, les couleurs dansent sous le ciel,
Chaque fleur, un poème, chaque brise, un arc-en-ciel,
Dans la symphonie de la nature, notre cœur trouve son refrain,
Dans cette célébration de la vie, nous sommes le soleil et la pluie.

In ogni piccola cosa, una bellezza da scoprire,
Nel canto degli uccelli, una melodia per vivere,
Ogni momento un capolavoro, dipinto dalla vita,
Nella gioia del mondo, troviamo la nostra rita.

Embracing the beauty, abbracciando la bellezza,
In life's vibrant dance, nella danza vivace della vita,
Every moment a treasure, ogni attimo un tesoro,
In this world of wonders, in questo mondo di meraviglie.

From the mountain's majesty to the ocean's deep blue grace,
Every sunrise a masterpiece, in time and space,
In the laughter of the rivers, in the quiet of the night,
Life's beauty surrounds us, in every sound and sight.

Dans le souffle du vent, nel sussurro del mare,
Feeling life's pulse, sentendo il polso della vita,
Chaque étoile, ogni fiore, a story to be told,
In the tapestry of life, nel tessuto della vita, we behold.

Sous le ciel étoilé, under the moon's gentle glow,
Nous célébrons la vie, with every heartbeat's flow,
In the dance of the seasons, dans la danse des saisons,
Life's beauty unfolds, la beauté de la vie se révèle.

Embracing the beauty, abbracciando la bellezza,
In life's vibrant dance, nella danza vivace della vita,
Every moment a treasure, ogni attimo un tesoro,
In this world of wonders, in questo mondo di meraviglie.
In ogni risveglio, vediamo il mondo risplendere,
Celebrando ogni giorno, con il cuore pieno di meraviglie,
La bellezza della vita, in ogni respiro sentire,
Nel viaggio del mondo, sempre da scoprire.

Stepping out into the unknown,
With a heart that's fully grown.

"Sous le ciel étoilé, je prends mon envol,
Dans un monde inconnu, je cherche mon rôle.
La brise me chuchote des secrets anciens,
Je suis prêt pour un voyage qui n'aura pas de fin.

Stepping into the unknown, with the wind at my back,
The horizon calls my name, there's nothing I lack.
Every step, a new story, every turn, a surprise,
In the heart of adventure, my spirit flies.

Voyage, voyage, to lands far and wide (Voyage, voyage),
La découverte dans chaque aube, dans chaque tide.
Feel the rush, le frisson de l'inconnu,
Exploring the world, c'est un rêve devenu vrai.

Traversant des déserts, des montagnes majestueuses,
Chaque défi est un cadeau, des expériences précieuses.
Dans le miroir des eaux profondes, je me découvre,
Chaque lieu une leçon, chaque moment me couvre.

In the dance of the cultures, dans la symphonie des voix,
Finding unity in diversity, c'est le vrai choix.
Les étoiles comme guides, stars lighting the way,
In every language, l'aventure est là pour toujours.

Through the valleys and peaks, I've found my truth,
In the faces and stories of unending youth.
Every goodbye is a hello to a new dawn,
In this journey of life, we're never truly gone.

Voyage, voyage, plus loin que la nuit et le jour (Voyage),
L'aventure nous appelle avec amour.
Feel the pulse, le battement du coeur de la terre,
Exploring forever, dans ce monde sans frontière.","FR,EN",GPT,,sous le ciel étoilé je prends mon envol dans un monde inconnu je cherche mon rôle la brise me chuchote des secrets anciens je suis prêt

"Dans le jardin de mon cœur, ton amour a fleuri,
Comme une rose éternelle, tu as illuminé ma vie.
Chaque regard partagé, un poème non écrit,
Dans tes bras, je trouve un refuge infini.

With every beat of my heart, I feel you close,
In your eyes, a universe, where love overflows.
Every whisper, a symphony, in the silence of the night,
In the canvas of our love, we paint with starlight.

Amour, amour, you're my endless dream (Amour, amour),
Dans tes yeux, I find the stars' gleam.
Feel the warmth, la chaleur de nos âmes enlacées,
In your arms, love's timeless dance forever sways.

Sous la lune argentée, nos cœurs battent à l'unisson,
Chaque mot doux, une mélodie qui défie le temps.
Dans le silence de la nuit, nos rêves se tissent,
Main dans la main, rien n'est impossible.

In the whisper of the wind, dans le souffle du vent,
We find our melody, notre chanson du temps.
Love's language universal, l'amour sans frontière,
In every heartbeat, dans chaque battement, je te revere.

Through seasons and years, our love remains true,
In the map of our journey, every road leads to you.
Every laughter, a promise, every tear, a new dawn,
In the story of us, love's eternal song.

Amour, amour, like a star never fading (Amour, amour),
Dans ton amour, je trouve ma vérité.
Feel the depth, la profondeur de notre lien éternel,
In our hearts, love's eternal spring forever dwells.","FR,EN",GPT,,dans le jardin de mon cœur ton amour a fleuri comme une rose éternelle tu as illuminé ma vie chaque regard partagé un poème non écrit

" Sur le chemin de ma vie, j'ai cherché qui je suis,
Dans le miroir du temps, mon reflet s'est construit.
À travers les orages, les épreuves à franchir,
Je me suis trouvé, dans l'ombre j'ai appris.

Every step, a story, every fall, a rise,
In the puzzle of my soul, I find the prize.
From the shadows to the light, from the ashes, I fly,
With every tear and smile, I touch the sky.

Growing, growing, on this journey so profound (Growing, growing),
Dans chaque épreuve, my inner strength is found.
Feel the change, le changement au fond de moi,
In this dance of life, je deviens qui je dois.

Face aux miroirs brisés, j'ai vu ma vérité,
Chaque éclat, un éclat de ma réalité.
Dans le silence de mon cœur, j'ai entendu un appel,
À devenir la version la plus vraie de moi-même.

In the quiet of the night, dans la paix du soir,
I hear my inner voice, c'est mon histoire.
Embracing every part, chaque partie de mon être,
Finding peace within, dans le calme, je renaître.

With every challenge faced, I've grown more and more,
In the garden of my soul, I let my spirit soar.
Through the storms and calm, I've found my way,
In the journey of self, I bloom each day.

Growing, growing, dans cette quête sans fin (Growing, growing),
Trouvant ma voie, mon chemin.
Feel the power, la force de mon cœur battant,
In this journey of me, je grandis éternellement.

"너와의 첫 만남, 마음이 뛰기 시작할 때,
별빛 아래 속삭임, 달빛 속에서 너를 봤어.
네 눈빛 속에 반짝이는, 사랑의 불꽃을 느꼈어,
너와 함께라면, 어떤 순간도 특별해져.

In your eyes, I found a world so bright and new,
Every moment with you feels like a dream come true.
In the dance of our hearts, where love takes flight,
We find our rhythm under the moonlit night.

사랑, Love, in every beat of our hearts ,
너와 나의 이야기, the story of you and me starts.
손에 손을 잡고, Holding hands, walking this way,
함께라면, Together, love leads the way.

너의 웃음에, 모든 걱정들이 사라져,
너와의 모든 순간, 마법처럼 느껴져.
너는 내 삶의 빛, 가장 아름다운 선물,
너와의 시간, 영원히 간직하고파.

In your embrace, 네 품에서, I find my peace,
사랑의 언어로, With the language of love, all fears cease.
우리의 꿈, Our dreams, intertwined so tight,
서로의 마음, In each other’s hearts, we take flight.

With every laugh and tear, we've grown so close,
In the melody of love, we find our sweet repose.
You're my north star, guiding me through the night,
In your love, I've found my eternal light.

사랑, Love, it's the melody we sing ,
너와 나, You and I, together in everything.
이 손을 놓지 않을게, I won't let go of your hand,
함께라면, Together, in love we stand.","KO,EN",GPT,,너와의 첫 만남 마음이 뛰기 시작할 때 별빛 아래 속삭임 달빛 속에서 너를 봤어 네 눈빛 속에 반짝이는 사랑의 불꽃을 느꼈어 너와 함께라면 어떤 순간도 특별해져 in your eyes i found a world so bright and new every moment

"가을 바람이 불어오면, 옛 사랑이 생각나,
그리운 얼굴, 잊을 수 없는 그날들.
너와 걷던 그 길 위에, 낙엽이 가득해,
너와의 추억, 한 장의 사진처럼 떠올라.

The echo of your laughter, a melody in my heart,
In the silence of my room, where our world fell apart.
The ghost of your touch, still lingers in the air,
In every corner, a memory of the love we used to share.

잊혀지지 않는 사랑, Unforgettable love, in the whispers of the night,
너와 나눴던 시간, The times we shared, still shining bright.
마음의 틈새로, Through the cracks of my heart, your memory flows,
잃어버린 사랑, Lost love, like a rose that never grows.

차가운 겨울밤, 네 생각에 잠 못 이루고,
빗물처럼, 너의 이름을 부르면서.
우리의 사랑은 변했지만, 아직도 마음속에,
너는 내 영원한 봄, 잊을 수 없는 꿈.

In the silence, 침묵 속에서, I hear your voice calling me,
너의 그림자, Your shadow, in everything I see.
사랑의 노래, Love's song, now a lullaby of pain,
잊혀지지 않는, Unforgettable, like the gentle autumn rain.

In the book of my life, you're a chapter of gold,
A story of love, now a legend of old.
In the moonlight's embrace, I find solace in the night,
Holding onto the sweet memory, of when we were right.

잊혀지지 않는 사랑, Unforgettable love, in the tears I cry ,
너와의 소중한 추억, Precious memories, in the starry sky.
가슴 아픈 사랑의 노래, The painful song of love, echoes in my soul,
잃어버린 사랑, Lost love, in my heart, you play a role.","KO,EN",GPT,,가을 바람이 불어오면 옛 사랑이 생각나 그리운 얼굴 잊을 수 없는 그날들 너와 걷던 그 길 위에 낙엽이 가득해 너와의 추억 한 장의 사진처럼 떠올라 the echo of your laughter a melody in my heart in the

"Nelle notti silenziose, il tuo ricordo mi visita,
Come un'ombra leggera, dolce e infinita.
Le strade vuote sussurrano il tuo nome,
In ogni angolo, un'eco del nostro amore.

En cada estrella, veo tus ojos brillar,
La luna llena me trae tu suspirar.
La distancia es cruel, pero en mis sueños estás,
En cada pensamiento, aún me haces volar.

Nostalgia, Nostalgia, nel cuore una melodia,
En la soledad, in solitudine, tu amor todavía.
Ricordi, Recuerdos, en cada suspiro mío,
In ogni momento, en cada momento, siento tu vacío.

Sotto la luce dell'alba, la tua assenza pesa di più,
Ogni momento senza te, come un cielo senza blu.
Le tue parole, un'eco in un cuore spezzato,
In ogni risveglio, un sogno mai realizzato.

In ogni lacrima, en cada lágrima, una storia non finita,
Nella nostalgia, en la nostalgia, una vita non scritta.
Il dolore dell'amore, el dolor del amor, ci unisce nel passato,
In ogni ricordo, en cada recuerdo, sei ancora a mio fianco.

En el silencio de la noche, tu ausencia me abraza,
Cada recuerdo, una llama que nunca se apaga.
Este anhelo me enseña, el poder del amor verdadero,
En cada espacio vacío, estás tú, mi único deseo.

Nostalgia, Nostalgia, in ogni alba, in ogni sera ,
En cada paso, in ogni respiro, l'essenza di una primavera.

"Sotto il cielo di luglio, la città prende vita,
Luci scintillanti, una festa infinita.
Le strade si animano, con risate e canzoni,
Nelle notti d'estate, viviamo senza confini.

El aire cálido susurra secretos y aventuras,
Bajo las estrellas, la noche nos susurra.
La libertad nos llama, en cada calle y cada rincón,
En estas noches de verano, encontramos nuestra pasión.

Estate, Verano, una danza sotto la luna ,
Riendo y cantando, la noche nos une y acuna.
Calor y magia, calore e magia, en el aire de la ciudad,
En cada esquina, in ogni angolo, un mundo de libertad.

La luna brilla alta, guidando i nostri passi,
Rivelando sogni nascosti, sotto i suoi riflessi.
Ogni incontro un destino, ogni sguardo una storia,
Nelle notti d'estate, ogni momento è gloria.

En la luz de las estrellas, nella luce delle stelle,
Sentimos la vida, sentiamo la vita, vibrante y bella.
Risas y sueños, risate e sogni, se entrelazan en la noche,
En esta fiesta, in questa festa, todo es posible, todo se acerca.

En la calma de la noche, el mundo parece nuevo,
Cada momento un regalo, cada experiencia un juego.
Las calles nos invitan, a vivir sin miedo,
En esta noche de verano, todo es un deseo.

Estate, Verano, con il battito del cuore ,
Bailando y viviendo, en la noche encontramos amor.
Calor y magia, calore e magia, en esta noche sin fin,
En cada risa, in ogni risata, la vita ci invita a unir.","IT,ES",GPT,,sotto il cielo di luglio la città prende vita luci scintillanti una festa infinita le strade si animano con risate e canzoni nelle

Ogni momento di dubbio, apre nuovi orizzonti.

"Moyo wangu unakuita, katika kimya cha usiku,
Kila nyota angani, inakumbusha macho yako.
Katika ndoto zangu, nakukumbatia kwa upendo,
Lakini macho yangu yakifunguka, upo mbali mno.

In the quiet of the night, I feel your presence near,
Yet the dawn reminds me, you're not here.
Every memory a treasure, in my heart so deep,
In my dreams, it's your love I keep.

Mapenzi, Love, burning like an eternal flame 
Nakutamani, I yearn for you, in every way.
Your absence, kukosekana kwako, leaves my heart in pain,
In my every thought, kila wazo, you remain.

Sauti yako ni wimbo, unaonijaza furaha,
Lakini ukimya ukinijia, moyo wangu unajawa na huzuni.
Kila kumbukumbu ni tamu, lakini pia na machungu,
Katika mapenzi haya, kuna safari isiyo na mwisho.

Katika umbali, In the distance, I feel your touch,
Katika kila wimbo, In every song, I hear your voice so much.
Kukumbuka, Remembering, our hearts intertwined,
In this love, katika mapenzi haya, our souls aligned.

Through seasons and time, my love only grows,
In every sunrise and sunset, my affection shows.
The longing for you, a constant echo in my heart,
In this dance of love, we're never apart.

Mapenzi, Love, like the stars above so bright ,
Nakutamani, I yearn for you, every day and night.
In your absence, katika kukosekana kwako, I find my love's true test,
In my heart, moyoni mwangu, you'll always be my guest.","SW,EN",GPT,,moyo wangu unakuita katika kimya cha usiku kila nyota angani inakumbusha macho yako katika ndoto zangu nakukumbatia kwa upendo

"Katika safari ya maisha, marafiki ni hazina,
Wakati wa furaha, na katika huzuni pia.
Kicheko chetu pamoja, kama muziki mtamu,
Katika kila kumbukumbu, urafiki wetu ni nguzo.

In the tapestry of life, friends are the brightest thread,
Through every twist and turn, by them, we are led.
Their laughter and support, a light in every way,
In the story of our lives, they bring the brightest day.

Urafiki, Friendship, a bond that never breaks ,
Tunashirikiana, We share, every joy and ache.
Laughing together, kucheka pamoja, under the sun's glow,
In friendship, katika urafiki, our true colors show.

Katika nyakati ngumu, marafiki ni ngao,
Wakitupa nguvu, katika kila changamoto.
Mikono yao inatupa, msaada wenye thamani,
Katika dunia yenye changamoto, wao ni zawadi ya maishani.

Kwa maneno, With words, and in silence, kimya, they understand,
Katika kicheko, In laughter, and in tears, machozi, they lend a hand.
Urafiki, Friendship, is more than just being near,
It's a feeling, ni hisia, that holds us dear.

Through seasons of change, in them, we find our home,
In the pages of our journey, their love is the tome.
In every shared secret, every hug and smile,
Friendship, the treasure, that makes life worthwhile.

Urafiki, Friendship, it's the heart's sweet song ,
Tunashirikiana, Together, through right and wrong.
In this bond, katika muungano huu, we find our greatest treasure,
In friendship, katika urafiki, we find endless pleasure.","SW,EN",GPT,,katika safari ya maisha marafiki ni hazina wakati wa furaha na katika huzuni pia kicheko chetu pamoja kama muziki mtamu katika

Through every trial and triumph, we've grown so bold,
With stories of courage, and tales untold.
In each sunset and sunrise, in every starlit night,

"Unter dem Sternenhimmel, denke ich an dich,
Deine Augen leuchten, wie Sterne, so stolz und reich.
In deiner Abwesenheit, ist mein Herz allein,
Doch in meinen Träumen, da bist nur du allein.

In the stillness of the night, I hear your name,
In my heart, a burning flame.
The distance between us, only makes me see,
In this love, in dieser Liebe, you and me.

Liebe, Love, it's a fire in my soul ,
Vermissen, Missing, makes me feel whole.
Sehnsucht, Longing, in every breath I take,
In our love, in unserer Liebe, my heart does wake.

In meinen Träumen, sind wir immer nah,
Durch Zeiten und Entfernungen, du bist da.
Jeder Augenblick, jeder Gedanke, ist ein Kuss,
In dieser Liebe, in dieser Liebe, verlieren wir uns.

In every memory, in jeder Erinnerung, I find your grace,
In the warmth of your love, in der Umarmung, your embrace.
Liebe, Love, it's the rhythm of our song,
In our hearts, in unseren Herzen, we both belong.

Through every season, our love remains,
In laughter and tears, through joy and pains.
In the story of us, in every line,
In dieser Liebe, our hearts entwine.

Liebe, Love, it's a melody so sweet ,
Vermissen, Missing, when we can't meet.
Sehnsucht, Longing, in this love, I'm free,
In unserer Liebe, in our love, you and me.","DE,EN",GPT,,unter dem sternenhimmel denke ich an dich deine augen leuchten wie sterne so stolz und reich in deiner abwesenheit ist mein herz allein doch in

"In der Stille der Nacht, blicke ich nach vorn,
Mit jedem Atemzug, mit jedem neuen Morgen.
Kein Berg ist zu hoch, keine Straße zu weit,
In unseren Herzen, in unseren Herzen, brennt der Streit.

With every step, we'll break through the storm,
In unity, together, we'll transform.
No obstacle too great, no trial too severe,
In our journey, in unserer Reise, we persevere.

Durchhalten, Hold on, through the darkest night ,
Stärker werden, Growing stronger, in the fiercest fight.
Unsere Träume, Our dreams, will light the way,
In unserer Reise, in our journey, come what may.

In der Hitze des Augenblicks, finden wir den Weg,
In jedem Augenblick, in jedem Lebensreg.
Mit Entschlossenheit, gehen wir unseren Lauf,
In unserem Herzen, in unserem Herzen, ist der Glaube tief.

In every challenge, In jeder Herausforderung, we find our might,
Mit Zuversicht, With confidence, we'll take flight.
Durchhalten, Hold on, in unity we stand,
In unserer Reise, in our journey, hand in hand.

Through every trial, we'll find our grace,
In every battle, we'll set the pace.
With hearts ablaze, we'll reach the stars above,
In dieser Reise, in this journey, we'll conquer with love.

"In der Dunkelheit der Nacht, blicken wir nach vorn,
Ein Funken Hoffnung, in unseren Herzen geborn.
Durch jeden Sturm, durch jede Prüfung, werden wir geh'n,
In unserem Glauben, in unserem Glauben, werden wir besteh'n.

In the depths of our souls, we find the light,
Through every challenge, we'll take flight.
With courage in our hearts, we'll face the unknown,
In dieser Hoffnung, in this hope, our strength has grown.

Hoffnung, Hope, it's a beacon in the night ,
Vertrauen, Trust, in the darkest fight.
Unsere Träume, Our dreams, like stars they gleam,
In dieser Hoffnung, in this hope, we'll chase our dream.

In den schwierigsten Momenten, werden wir standhaft sein,
Die Zukunft gestalten, mit Entschlossenheit und Pein.
Die Welt mag stürmen, die Zeiten mögen wechseln,
In unserem Herzen, in unserem Herzen, werden wir nicht verwechseln.

In every setback, In jedem Rückschlag, we'll find our way,
Mit Zuversicht, With confidence, we'll seize the day.
Hoffnung, Hope, a guiding star so bright,
In dieser Hoffnung, in this hope, we'll reach the height.

Through the trials we face, we'll emerge so strong,
With every challenge, we'll prove them wrong.
In the story we write, with each page we turn,
In dieser Hoffnung, in this hope, our souls will burn.

Hoffnung, Hope, it's the anthem of our heart,
Vertrauen, Trust, is where we'll start.
Unsere Träume, Our dreams, will take the lead,
In dieser Hoffnung, in this hope, we'll succeed.","DE,EN",GPT,,in der dunkelheit der nacht blicken wir nach vorn ein funken hoffnung in unseren herzen geborn durch jeden sturm durch jede prüfung

Is it too late?

Don't wanna be selfish but I need you right now

"When I'm with you it feels like we're Dodi and Diana
I'm lucky that I have ya
Cuz they don't wanna see us together
Like Dodi and Diana
Baby i'm a hopeless romantic
خلي بالك
You might just see the antics
يا حبيبتي أنا عاشق لجمالك
ومفيش زي احساسك
If I pull to your crib, no rush to make it quick
I made some reservations
It's ok if we don't make it
Lets get intimate, I'm London for the week
Girl you need some memories you can keep
When I'm with you it feels like we're Dodi and Diana
I'm lucky that I have ya
Cuz they don't wanna see us together
Like Dodi and Diana
You're a princess, I can't leave you empty handed babe
يا حياتي
What you want
You can have it
بصيلي
Baby feel me
Cuz it might be the last time
You can't commit to me, it's cuz of where I'm from
But your body language speaks to me
I know you're in love
It's mutual
For you I would lose it all
When I'm with you it feels like we're Dodi and Diana

"We met at this bar on the beach
6' foot 3 he was looking at me
Eyes as blue as the waters right behind him
I could feel he was looking at me
I could feel this intense energy
Surely enough we were both struck by the lighting
I wish I could take him home with me
He'd look good under California trees
When we danced to his foreign melody
Bodies in time, that's when he said to me
Ma chérie, ma chérie
You and me, c'est love pour la vie
Oh, jolie, it was so good to meet you
Oh, merci for all that we've been through
Ma chérie, ma chérie
I will never forget, c'est promis
Oh, jolie, it was so good to meet you
Oh, merci for all that we've been through, ma chérie
Reminiscing when we used to be
Sipping piña colada so sweet
Under the lust and the moonshine right behind him
I wish I just took him home with me
He'd look good under California trees
When we danced to his foreign melody
Bodies in time, that's when he said to me
Ma chérie, ma chérie

Expensive when you're moaning
Hop on a Zoom call for an hour
Then come back to show you who own it
Fly you to Beirut for the wintertime
Don't post about it online (okay)
Took her to dinner in Hamra
And one thing she kept telling me
She has very few friends
She's focused and has very few friends
فقلتلها
You take away all my focus
But I'm down
Gotta bring you back to my town
طيارة دغري علي بلادي

I'll show you around
Bienvenue dans mon quartier
Sur son bracelet c'est du Cartier
Elle veux que je lui parle en français
I wanna take you to Paris and spoil you
I wanna go to Marseille and enjoy you
I want those guys in your DMs to talk to themselves
And then tell all their friends that they know you
I wanna make you forget about your ex
I want you overthinking all your texts
I want the neighbors to hear you yell
Told me she's a CEO, I can tell
So you do you
And I'll do me

"Baby, see me
Need you to see me, why won't you see me?
Girl, come see me
I've been running rounds, rounds, rounds around the world
And I can't stop
These days I know I won't back up
These days I know I won't stop it
These days I wanna be more (be more), oh, more
You said you wanna find yourself (find yourself)
Said you wanna find yourself more
But instead, you are wasting time, here and there

الكره جاي من الطرفين
إيدي في إيدك، مستغربة ليه
بعاد عن بعض ومش عارف ليه
الدنيا صغيرة بس الغربة وين؟

That's why I never let my past go
Even though it's blank pages on the passport
She doesn't like seeing the fast growth
But time moves slowly on the glass boats

So many lows whеn I go look back
Nobody knows what I burn in ash
The life I left outsidе baby
Can't back out here this they can't save me
I never meant to be this way
I was supposed to be in class on my A game
And my daddy doesn't understand what I do
Running two tracks loud like a haiku

You should be proud, auntie, look at her go
In two more years I'll have my knee on the floor

Four daughters, one son, why you laughing?
I want a house on the hills on the coast of Brazil

You understand me, uh?
So you know I that I don't really wanna take you to Miami
I'd rather go Tunisia and just turn off our phones

"You should've seen the way she looked, igual que un ángel
Heaven's her residence, y ella no se va a caer
They just can't reach her, princesita inalcanzable
Le rompieron el cora', pero nunca se la perdió, oh
Todos quieren plata, otros quieren fama
Un amor superficial
Pero ella quiere calma, no dañar su alma
Nunca se olvida de lo real
Un corazón como el tuyo está en extinció-o-on
Heaven must have sent you, love
Un corazón como el tuyo está en extinció-o-on
Heaven must have sent you, love
La favorita de Dios, la favorita de Dios
And it shows
Sent from Heaven down to Earth
La favorita de Dios, la favorita de Dios
And she knows
Sent from Heaven down to Earth
Ya le juraron amor, y le fallaron
Ojitos secos de todo lo que lloraron
Pero ella no se rinde, sonríe aunque le duela
Porque personas como ella ya no quedan
Todos quieren plata, otros quieren fama
Un amor superficial
Pero ella quiere calma, no dañar su alma
Nunca se olvida de lo real
Un corazón como el tuyo está en extinció-o-on

And she knows
Sent from Heaven down to Earth
Uh, con esa actitud
Nadie la merece
El que la quiera, que rece
Porque ella es luz, ay, nada que ver
No está a tu alcance
La nena es un ángel
Todos quieren plata, otros quieren fama
Un amor superficial
Pero ella quiere calma, no dañar su alma
Nunca se olvida de lo real
Un corazón como el tuyo está en extinció-o-on

"I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight


Forget the small talk
The surface level ain’t much that I care for
Putting on my lip gloss
I saw you stare from my peripheral, yeah


Baby, it’s been a hell of a day
But I know a place we can escape
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
When you’re here with me


I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight


There’s nothing like peace of mind
And you take the time to make sure that I’m okay
I know I can put stress on your brain
(You still love me, put no one above me)


You always go out of your way
To show me that I’m your priority
Find out how it feels to let go of everything, be free
When you’re here with me


I just wanna get high with my lover
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (I just wanna get high with my lover)
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight
I just wanna get high with my lover (Get high)
Veo una muñeca cuando miro en el espejo (High with my lover)
Kiss, kiss, looking dolly, I think I may go out tonight
I just wanna ride, get high in the moonlight


Get higher with you
Get higher and higher with you
Let’s go to the moon
And leave behind all that
How does it feel, here by my side getting higher and higher?
Under the moonlight’s glow
There’s nowhere we won’t go
Together go higher and higher
No-no-nowhere we won’t go

"Quién lo diría
Que se podría hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
Y me dicen todo lo que estás pensando
Me imagino lo que ya estás maquinando
Quién lo diría
Que se podría hacer el amor por telepatía
La luna está llena, mi cama vacía
Lo que yo te haría
Si te tuviera de frente, la mente te la volaría
De noche y de día, de noche y de día
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind
I can read your mind
What you want to do?
It's written all over your face times two
'Cause I can read your mind
I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
On repeat

눈 감고, pop-pop, 안 봐도 척
One by one, then two by two
내 손끝 툭 하나에 다 무너지는 중
가짜 쇼 치곤 화려했지
Makes no sense, you couldn't get a dollar out of me

네 혼을 빼앗은 다음, look what you made us do

This that pink venom, this that pink venom
This that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa

Taste that pink venom, taste that pink venom
Taste that pink venom (get 'em, get 'em, get 'em)
Straight to ya dome like whoa-whoa-whoa
Straight to ya dome like ah-ah-ah
Black paint and ammo', got bodies like Rambo
Rest in peace, please, light up a candle
This the life of a vandal, masked up, and I'm still in CELINE
Designer crimes, or it wouldn't be me, ooh!
Diamonds shining, drive in silence, I don't mind it, I'm riding
Flying private side by side with the pilot up in the sky
And I'm wyling, styling on them and there's no chance
'Cause we got bodies on bodies like this a slow dance

"BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh
BLACKPINK in your area, eh-oh
컴백이 아냐, 떠난 적 없으니까
고개들이 돌아, 진정해, 목 꺾일라
분홍빛의 얼음 drip, drip, drip, freeze 'em on sight
Shut it down, what, what, what, what?
게임이 아냐, 진 적이 없으니까
짖어봐, 네 목에 목줄은 내 거니까
땅바닥에 닿은 pedal, we go two-zero-five
Shut it down, uh-uh-uh-uh
초록 비를 내려 머리 위로, don't trip, baby
겸손하게 그냥 앉아있어, just sit, baby
Praying for my downfall, many have tried, baby
Catch me when you hear my Lamborghini go vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom
When we pull up, you know it's a shut down
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
It's black and it's pink once the sun down
When we pull up, you know it's a shut down
간판 내리고 문 잠가 shut down
Whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it, whip it
Keep watchin' me shut it down
Nah, you don't wanna be on my bad side
That's right, I'm slidin' through
Bunch of wannabes that wanna be me
Me three if I was you
Been around the world, pearls on ya, girl
VVS's we invested, uh
Need a lesson, see the necklace, see these dresses
We don't buy it, we request it, uh
A rock star, a pop star, but rowdier
Say bye to the paparazzi
Get my good side, I'll smile for ya
Know it ain't fair to ya, it's scarin' ya like what now?
BLACKPINK in your area, the area been shut down
It's a shut down
